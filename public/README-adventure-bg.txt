To add a custom adventure background image:

1. Copy your desired canyon/adventure background image to this public folder
2. Rename it to "adventure-bg.jpg" 
3. Update the ChooseYourAdventure component to use: backgroundImage: `url('/adventure-bg.jpg')`

Current setup uses imported image from assets folder as fallback.

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Aspect ratio: 16:9 or wider
- Subject: Canyon, mountains, adventure landscape
- Lighting: Good contrast for text overlay
